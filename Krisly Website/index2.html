I guided myself with some materials<br> from class and also videos from youtube. This project was fun but also a little<br> bit difficult since it's my first time using this program. I hope you like it.

Title: AUDIO project statement<br>
Semester/Year: Spring 2020<br>
Software: Audacity<br><br>

This audio represents and tells a brief story of a young girl on a rainy day.<br> First you can listen how she serves her coffee then give it a sip (while sitting on the table) <br>and the grabs a book to do her homework but then she gets bored and <br>walks towards the radio and play some music. I chose to tell this story because it represents me.<br> This project was a little bit challenging to do and I chose 8 audios to tell this story. I didn't use any effects.

    Title: Vector <br>

Semester/Year: Spring 2020<br>

Software: Illustrator<br><br>

I chose this color just because their are my favorite color and the Zebra animal print it's my favorite too. The Zebra animal print meaning is "free spirit" and also "a person who has gone through a lot but even thought that they keep that free spirit".<br> Lastly I got inspired by myself and the meaning of the Zebra animal print as well. Once again it was pretty easy to complete this assignment.
