        <p class="parraf">
            My name is Krisly Rosario and I'm 20 years old. I was born and raised in Dominican Republic. I moved to the United States on 2018 and on 2019 I started to study at BMCC Multimedia Programming and Design. Before the pandemic started a passion for Film photography began.<br><br>This type of photography has become a hobby for me but because of the pandemic I'm not able to let that passion and skills grow.<br><br>I see myself in the future as a productive person, with all my goals and profession accomplish.
